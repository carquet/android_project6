## News app stage 1
The goal is to create a News Feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet related to a particular topic, person, or location. The presentation of the information as well as the topic is up to you.
This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

- Connecting to an API
- Parsing the JSON response
- Handling error cases gracefully
- Updating information regularly
- Using an AsyncTask
- Doing network operations independent of the Activity lifecycle

## News app stage 2
The goal is to add a Settings Screen to the News Feed app we made earlier in stage 1 which will allow users to narrow down the stories displayed in from the feed. The available preference options presented to the user will be left up to you to decide (e.g. publishing time, country, topic category, etc. )

- Implement the Preference Fragment
- Launch a Settings Activity from a menu in the Main Activity
- Use Uri.Builder class to add query parameters to the URL
- Update and display the Preference Summary
